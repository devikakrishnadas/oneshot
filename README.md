Just in case you are wondering, the inspiration for the name "OneShot" comes from Eminem's Lose Yourself. 

__So, what this all is about!__

This repository is a todo-list/bucket-list/syllabus for the computer-sciency things I wanted to study and dive into since last 3-4 years.

This is a little something my friend compiled and now I'm modifying it for myself. 

### __`Q: Why is this so important to me?`__

For starters, my knowledge in CS is no where near I want it to be. And I often find myself clueless in technical conversations and this is probably a way to deal with what I feel.


From OneShot, I expect these few things, which I've divided into following categories - 

#### __`Habits`__

- Write good code.
- Read Research Papers.
- Do more maths.
- Increase focus.
- To be disciplined.
- Blogging and Journaling.
- Keep contributing to the Open Source.
- Two cigarettes in a week.

#### __`Goals`__

- To be good at Mathematics.
- To be good in Data Structure, and Algorithms.
- To be good in System Programming, Operating Systems, and C.
- To be good at Network Programming.
- To be able to read domain related search papers. 
- To have a keen interest in P2P networks.
- To have an understanding of distributed systems and do some stuff with it.
- Build and understand cool things like compilers and interpreters etc.
- To implement protocols and build cool stuff, and ship some them.
- Make to the GSoC and other cool stuff next year.

### `Conclusion`

Don't want to jump to any conclusion. I'll work my ass off, let's see what happens!
